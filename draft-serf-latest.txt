                  Secruity Event Refinement Framework
                           draft-serf-latest

Abstract

   Millions of low-level events, such as byte counters, triggered filter
   policies, or interaction attempts, are created continuously in a
   multitude of network topologies.  Constrained-node networks, such as
   sensor networks, smart meters in LPWAN, or vehicle networks with
   various interconnected layer 2 topologies, exhibit domain-specific
   behaviors that can be considered to be compliant or - in contrast -
   as potential anomalies in regard to declarative guidance.  In order
   to facilitate an automated assessment of the behavior of
   interconnected components that constitute, for example, service
   chains or downstream work-flows, available low-level events have to
   be brought into a larger semantic context by refining them into a
   lower volume of security events with a higher grade of expressiveness
   or significance.  This work describes an architecture, its
   corresponding components, interfaces and interaction model, as well
   as a security event information model to facilitate a refinement
   framework to process event streams via aggregation, correlation and
   machine-learning methods.  The components defined are virtual
   encapsulations of corresponding machine-learning and AI function that
   require certain features derived from the event data that is made
   available by low-level event streams.

1.  Introduction

   Security automation requires input of high refinement and high
   confidence to base corresponding security decisions on.  Vital tasks
   that depend on these refined security events include the verification
   of compliance in regard to the integrity of network separation
   (network slicing) or content of PDU flows and the assessment of the
   impact of identified vulnerabilities, configuration drift, or
   malfunctions that result in degraded availability or integrity of
   data.  Creating security events of high refinement from an staggering
   amount of (security) events of low refinement is the objective of the
   solution proposed in this document.  This document defines and
   illustrates five core elements that are required to facilitate a
   refinement process that conducts aggregation, correlation and
   analysis of event streams with machine learning and AI procedures in
   a distributed mash of virtual (and sometimes also hardware-bound)
   functions:

   o  an information sharing architecture that is feasible to be applied
      in the thing-2-thing scope, including a pub/sub approach virtual
      functions that are bundled in SERF components can exchange
      information with

   o  an information model that defines the basic set of information
      elements providing the features required for machine-learning
      functions and AI procedures to create output of higher refinement
      in order to satisfy common security requirements via automation
      procedures

   o  a concise data model for security events that can be interpreted
      and processed by SERF components to fuel correpsonding machine-
      learning functions and AI procedures

   o  two alternative architecture designs based on CoAP pub/sub
      interaction model and based on SSLS peer-2-peer topics that are
      brokered via a resource directory

   o  integration of content authorization into existing and emerging
      building-blocks that compose a SERF domain, leveraging solutions
      developed in the ACE work group

   The architectures defined in this document provide the capability to
   bundle machine-learning and AI procedures in SERF components in the
   form of virtual functions.  Hence, SERF components can be migrated,
   spawned and discarded to support dynamic changes in regard to
   processing capability and scalability.  The dynamic orchestration of
   the virtual functions that compose a SERF domain address the
   resilience and scalability required in the of malicious acts, such as
   DDoS attacks in production systems, targeted attacks at the SERF
   domain itself, or massive system failures that requires ad-hoc
   remediation.  SERF components are able to attest their integrity
   using traditional remote attestation and emerging attestation
   procedures (such as TUDA).  Heterogeneous sources of security events,
   such as proprietary anomaly detection components, netflow statistics,
   automobile ECU, actuators and sensors in ICS, or constrained-node
   networks in the thing-2-thing scope.
