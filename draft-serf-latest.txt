                  Secruity Event Refinement Framework
                           draft-serf-latest

Abstract

   Security automation requires input of high refinement and high
   confidence to base corresponding security decisions on.  Vital tasks
   that depend on these refined security events include, integrity of
   network separation (network slicing), traffic analysis, vulnerability
   assessment, configuration drift, or malfunction that results in
   degraded availability or integrity of data.  Creating security events
   of high refinement from the overwhelming amount of (security) events
   of low refinement is the objective of the solution proposed in this
   document.  This document defines and illustrate five core elements
   that are required to facilitate a refinement process conducts
   aggregation, correlation and analysis of event streams with machine
   learning and AI procedures in a distributed mash of virtual (and
   sometimes hardware-bound) functions:

   o  an information sharing architecture that is feasible in the thing-
      2-thing scope, including a pub/sub approach virtual functions that
      are bundled in SERF components can exchange information with

   o  an information model that defines the basic set of information
      elements that provides the features for machine learning functions
      and AI procedures to produce output of higher refinement that
      supports goals in security automation

   o  a concise data format for events that can be interpreted and
      processed by every SERF component that consumes (subscribed to)
      corresponding types of information (topics)

   o  alternative architecture implementation based on CoAP and CoMI
      CoAP pub/sub interaction models and SSLS peer-2-peer topics that
      are brokered via a corresponding resource directory

   o  integration of content authorization in existing and to be
      developed building-blocks that compose a SERF domain leveraging
      solutions developed in the ACE work group

   The resulting architecture provides the capability to bundle machine-
   learning and AI procedures in SERF components that compose virtual
   functions.  SERF components can be migrated and spawned to support
   dynamically changes in the requirements of processing capabilities to
   scale with the amount of security events that can spike in cases of
   malicious acts, such as DDoS or massive system failures.  SERF
   components are able to attest their integrity using traditional
   remote attestation and emerging attestation procedures (such as
   TUDA).  Heterogeneous sources of security events, such as proprietary
   anomaly detection components, netflow statistics, automobile ECU,
   actuators and sensors in ICS, or constrained-node networks in the
   thing-2-thing scope.
